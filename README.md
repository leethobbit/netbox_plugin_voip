# NetBox VOIP Plugin
This was a work-in-progress VOIP plugin for [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).
Based on the Django app skeleton that can be found [here](https://github.com/k01ek/netbox-plugin-skeleton).

NOTE: I have not completed this plugin, and it is only partially functional.

## The Purpose of this Plugin
This VOIP plugin is being created for two main reasons:
1. To have all relevant information such as DNs, DIDs, and Call Routes available in Netbox in a format that is modeled for VOIP.
2. To eventually be able to automate basic tasks such as phone or line updates/creation/deletion by simply making changes in Netbox.
