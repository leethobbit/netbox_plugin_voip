# NetBox VOIP Plugin
This is a VOIP plugin for [Netbox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).
Based on the Django app skeleton that can be found [here](https://github.com/k01ek/netbox-plugin-skeleton).

## The purpose of this plugin
This VOIP plugin is being created for two main reasons:
1. To have all relevant information such as DNs, DIDs, and Call Routes available in Netbox in a format that is modeled for VOIP.
2. To eventually be able to automate basic tasks such as phone/line updates/creation/deletion by simply making changes in Netbox.
